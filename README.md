# ChainInsure
ChainInsure is a decentralized insurance platform that protects users' digital assets against potential losses from hacks and market crashes when assets are used as collateral in a pool. The project is being developed for a Base Buildathon Hackathon with key features like wallet integration and automated payouts using smart contracts on the Base network.
